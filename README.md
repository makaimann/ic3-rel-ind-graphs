# ic3-rel-ind-graphs
Early-stage research project to analyze the dependency structure of invariants generated by IC3/PDR.

# Instructions

## Setup
Make the following scripts executable:
* `setup-IC3ref.sh`
* `get-hwmcc17.sh`
* `gen_graph.py`
* `test.sh`

Then run the following:
```
./setup-IC3ref.sh
./get-hwmcc17.sh
```

## Usage
To run on all hwmcc17 benchmarks with a timeout (set at top of script), run `./test.sh`

To run individually, do the following:
```
./IC3 --dump=<base name with no extension> < <benchmark>.aig
./gen_graph.py -t <dumped filename>-trans.cnf -i <dumped filename>-inv.cnf -ip <dumped filename>-inv-primed.cnf -o <output_name>
```

This will generate a graph `<output_name>.dot`.

You can also check that the dumped invariant is an inductive invariant with the following command:
```
./check_inv.py --init ./<dumpname>-init.cnf --trans ./<dumpname>-trans.cnf --inv ./<dumpname>-inv.cnf --primes ./<dumpname>-mapping.txt
```
